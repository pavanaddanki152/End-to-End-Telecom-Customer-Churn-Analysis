# End-to-End-Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn behavior in a telecom company, identify the key factors contributing to customer attrition, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention and service quality.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level information related to:
- Demographics (gender, senior citizen)
- Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Service subscriptions (phone service, internet type, security, backup, tech support)
- Customer churn status

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn analysis by:
  - Customer demographics
  - Tenure and contract type
  - Service subscriptions
  - Payment methods
- Visualization of churn patterns
- Business insight generation

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Gender does not have a significant impact on churn.
- Around **41% of senior citizens churn**, making them a high-risk segment.
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
- Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates.
- Customers without value-added services (online security, backup, device protection, tech support) churn more frequently.
- Customers using automatic payment methods churn significantly less than those using manual payment options.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Improve onboarding and engagement for new customers.
- Design senior-citizen-friendly plans and support services.
- Encourage long-term contracts through incentives.
- Bundle value-added services to increase perceived value.
- Improve service quality for fiber optic customers.
- Promote automatic payment methods to reduce churn risk.
